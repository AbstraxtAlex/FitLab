                    <p>
                        If the charge shows up twice right after you order, this is a pending charge for bank authorization. 
                        Banks regularly practice this during credit card transactions to ensure sufficient funds and account authenticity. 
                        This double charge will clear once your card is charged for real when your order ships. 
                        Please contact your bank with any questions, or to verify the charge.
